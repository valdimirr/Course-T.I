Also called the Play-In Stage, the entry phase opens for the 2017 World Cup and gives more teams a chance to play in the LoL tournament. 
In all there are 12 teams from different championships that were divided by lottery into four groups. 
It is a mix of smaller leagues like Brazil, Japan, Latin America (divided into North and South), Turkey, Oceania, Asia and Russia and larger like China, Europe, North America and Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau.</font>
